          <h2>The Walias: From Champions to Underdogs</h2>
          <p>
            “Adane! Saladin! Adane! Seladiiiin… Goooal!!” announced the elated
            football commentator. Everyone was cheering, some were crying in
            joy, and some were daydreaming of the promised land the national
            team was headed to. Ethiopia 2, Sudan 0. If the game concludes with
            this result, Ethiopians could start thinking about buying flight
            tickets to South Africa to support their national team in the
            upcoming African Cup of Nations. And so it was. After 31 years of
            waiting, the Ethiopian national team was to participate in the
            African Cup of Nations. But alas! The team could not make its way
            past the group stage.

            Ethiopia is known for several things. Its ancient civilization,
            coffee, athletic runners, and, maybe, its good-looking women.
            However, it is hard to say that the nickname “the Walias” or “the
            Ethiopian Football National Team” rings one's bell who is not really
            into Ethiopian Football. One might even ask, “Does Ethiopia even
            have an active national football team?” A quite reasonable question
            to ask. But what to say?
          </p>
          <p>
            The Ethiopian national team is a team with an intricate history that
            is worth looking at. Every single page features a new challenge, a
            new team, and a whole different picture. With an ever-changing style
            of football, the Walias with respect to other national teams seemed
            to be frozen in their progress. Ever since their golden age, their
            reputation eroded until nothing but the rubble of its once revered,
            grand history remained. However, this did not come about because
            Ethiopians suddenly stopped football or because the players were
            rendered unskilled. It is because of some underlying factors to be
            examined. But first, it is important to put things into perspective
            before we continue on. Let's head back to the golden age of
            Ethiopian football, the 1950s, and 1960s.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ethiopia has a long football tradition and was once amongst the most
            accomplished football teams in all of Africa. What's more, Ethiopia
            was one of the four countries that established what is today known
            as the Confederation of African Football (CAF). Ethiopia qualified
            for regional and continental competitions again and again, to the
            extent that it became nothing other than normal. The team had high
            set expectations, just like big clubs such as FC Barcelona and Real
            Madrid have today, always ending up in the top three by the end of
            every season.
          </p>
          <p>
            The trophy room of the national team is also not empty. In fact, the
            national team has multiple precious wins and achievements under its
            belt. The team was a one-time champion of the African Cup of
            Nations, four-time champions of the Council of East and Central
            Africa Football Association (CECAFA) cup, and many more occasions in
            which it was able to finish on the podium. This was a success that
            many could not hope for during that time.
          </p>
          <p>
            That team was undoubtedly “accomplished and successful” (Dr. Elias),
            especially in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. The team made seven
            consecutive appearances in the African Cup of Nations. However,
            somehow, something has hindered back the progress of the Walias
            since their golden age. Dr. Elias Abi, professional physical fitness
            coach and head of Decathlon Fitness Evaluation Laboratory remarked,
            “Our biggest problem is that we could not walk along with the
            ever-changing football.”
